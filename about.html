	<p>
	Hello there! and welcome to my website. I am a cartographer and data scientist based in Toronto. At the moment, this site acts as a visual library for a few of my mapping and photography projects.
	</p>
	<p>
	As of 10/2021, I am working towards a PhD in geography at the University of Toronto. I also occasionally work on freelance and consulting projects as time permits. My work and research generally falls within in the domains of urban planning, geography, and/or transportation.
	</p>
	<p>
	Check out my <a href="https://github.com/jamaps", target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile for some of my more technical projects, while my sporadically updated <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XFmML7cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target = "_blank">Google Scholar</a> or <a href = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff_Allen2 target = "_blank">ResearchGate</a> pages list published research papers that I've worked on during my PhD.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outside of work, you'll often find me exploring the streets of Toronto (usually by foot or by bike), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/118401999-jeff-allen?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read" target = "_blank">reading</a>, or creating <a href="maps.html">maps</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Feel free to contact me at <span style="color:blue">jeff.allen@utoronto.ca</span> if you have any comments or questions about anything you find here, or if you just want to say hi!
